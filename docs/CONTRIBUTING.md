## Issues

The main uses of issues:

- To track project tasks and features
- To document whatever code a member is working on that is not part of the project tasks and features
- To document any critical issues and bugs that need to be fixed
- To propose any new features for the project to pursue
- To track member's efforts in researching solutions for project-related issues and topics

Some guidelines for issues:

- Try to narrow down the issue to one change/ task/ problem, as much as possible
  * Your issue should ideally be small enough to enact only one or two "changes" on the code base
- Try to include the requirements/ steps your issue seeks to resolve, in the issue body
  * Doing so will make it easier for the code review to understand the purpose of the issue and decide whether or not the pull request satisfies the issues requirements
- Make you issue detailed and clear enough to understand
- Use labels for your issues
  - `critical issue` - for bugs or issues
  - `documentation` - supplementary materials that provide guidance to the project (ex: UML diagrams, mockups, etc)
  - `enhancements` - for suggesting new features for the project
  - `frontend` - used to denote issue is for frontend only
  - `backend` - used to denote issue is for backend only
  - `project-meta` - anything related to project configuration, operations, and devops
  - `question` - for any project-related questions that need to researched; solve this issue by dicussing what you learned in discord or through other means
  - `good first issue` - for any issues easy enough for beginners to do; this project is for learning, and such there will be small, easy tasks created for members who are new to software dev and want to learn
